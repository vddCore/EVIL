Ensign Virtual Interpreted Language - first interpreter and a programming language I implemented. Ever. And likely the last.

> ### **VirtualMachine**
> Contains _Ceres_ Translation & Execution Engine and accompanying language tests.

> ### **Shared**
> Everything else that doesn't fit the code stuff.EVIL source examples, syntax highlighters for various editors.

# Formal grammar definition
